Sum of even fibonacci numbers which are less than 4*10^6


Fibonacci numbers in this problem start from 1 and 2 (F0 and F1 respectively)
But we will use the standard 1,1 as starting numbers to dervie the series formula
Even number = Even number + Even number
or
Even number = odd number + odd number 

Fib series : Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 

F0 = 1
F1 = 1
F2 = 2 (even)
F3 = 3
F4 = 5
F5 = 8 (even)
F6 = 13
F7 = 21
F8 = 34 (even)

Notice the pattern>> F2,F5,F8 are even Fibonacci numbers

	>> every even fib number is offset by 3 numbers 
	>> Try to find Fn in terms of sum of Fn-3 or Fn-6 and so on


F2 = F1 + F0
>>

F5 = F4 + F3 
F4 = F3 + F2
F3 = F2 + F1 
F2 = F1 + F0 

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 
   = Fn-2 + Fn-3 + Fn-3 + Fn-4
   = Fn-3 + Fn-4 + Fn-3 + Fn-3 + Fn-5 + Fn-6
   = 3*Fn-3 + Fn-4 + Fn-5 + Fn-6
   = 4*Fn-3 + Fn-6

hence sum of even fib numbers less than a given limit L will be 
>> SUM(Fn) n:6 to L

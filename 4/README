Largest palindrome product

largest palindrome formed of 2 digit number product is 9009 (91*99)


we need to find the largest palindrome formed by product of two 3 digit numbers 

largest 3 digit numbers can be 999 and 999 and we can keep going down the list from 999, since multiplication of a*b=b*a, we can reduce one number at a time


We need to implement a isPalindrome for integers in utility
